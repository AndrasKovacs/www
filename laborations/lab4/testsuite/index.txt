= Introduction =

Before you submit [lab 4 ../lab4.html], your solution must pass the
testsuite. This document describes how to obtain and use
this testsuite.

= Preparations =

You will only need to do this part once.

%+ Make sure that at least version 1.4.2 (January 2018) of the
%  Haskell package [filepath https://hackage.haskell.org/package/filepath]
%  is installed:
%```
%$ ghc-pkg latest filepath
%```

+ Download [lab4-testsuite.tar.gz lab4-testsuite.tar.gz].

+ Unpack the downloaded file:
```
$ tar -zxf lab4-testsuite.tar.gz
```

%+ Enter the ``lab4-testsuite`` directory:
%```
%$ cd lab4-testsuite
%```
%
%+ Compile the test program using ``make`` or alternatively:
%```
%$ ghc -threaded --make -o progs-test-lab4 progs-test-lab4.hs
%```


= Running the testsuite =

This is what you need to do to test your interpreter.

+ Enter the ``lab4-testsuite`` directory (if you are not there already):
```
$ cd lab4-testsuite
```

+ Run ``progs-test-lab4.sh`` with the path to the directory where your solution is located:

```
$ ./progs-test-lab4.sh path/to/your/solution/
```
