=Summary=

The objective of this lab is to write a parser for a fragment
of the C++ programming language. The parser should return
an abstract syntax tree at success, and report an error
with a line number at failure.

Before the lab can be submitted, the parser has to pass some
tests, which are given on the course web page via links
later in this document.

The recommended implementation of the parser is via a BNF
grammar processed by the BNF Converter (BNFC) tool. The approximate
size of the parser source code should be 100 rules.

With BNFC, just the grammar (.cf file) has to be written and submitted
by the lab groups.



=Method=

Build the grammar gradually, so that you can parse
the six test files in the given order: as your first
goal, parse [the first test file testsuite/good/1-hello.cc].
then the second, and so on.

When you have passed one level, just try to parse
the next example with your current parser and examine
the line at which it fails. In this way, you will find
out what new grammar rules you need.

After treating the six tests, run the
[test script testsuite/index.html] to
make your parser perfect.

You can use any code generator (Haskell, Java, C,...) from BNFC. It
does not have to be the same language as you plan to use in later
labs.

==Debugging==

If you use Haskell, you have the advantage of
**info files**, which tell you exactly where the conflicts are.
Assuming your grammar file is ``CPP.cf`` and you have called ``bnfc``
on it, you can create an info file from the generated Happy file:
```
happy -i ParCPP.y
```
The info file is now in ``ParCPP.info``. Moreover, you can produce a
**debugging parser** by adding the ``-d`` flag to Happy. Update your Makefile like this:
```
happy -gcad ParCPP.y
```
And then run ``make`` again.
Running this parser shows a trace of the LR actions performed during parsing.

You can also get some debugging output when using the Java backend by calling CUPS with the ``-dump_states`` flag.
Edit your ``Makefile`` like this:
```
CUPFLAGS = -nopositions -expect 100 -dump_states
```
And then recompile your parser with:
```
make -B CPP/sym.class 2> parser.info
```
The ``parser.info`` file will contain some debugging information.
Unfortunately this format is harder to read than the info file generated by Happy (above).

=Language specification=

It is suitable to explain and advisable to implement the parser top-down,
starting with the largest units and proceeding to smaller ones.

The specification differs in some places from the official C++
specification.

To help you get going, we have marked with a bold (**//n//**) those
rules that are needed to parse the //n//th test file.



==Programs==

A **program** is a sequence of definitions. (**1**)

A program may also contain comments and preprocessor directives,
which are just ignored by the parser (see below). (**1**)


==Definitions==

+ A **function** definition has a type, a name, an argument list, and a body.
(**1**)  Example:
```
  int foo(double x, int y)
  {
    return y + 9 ;
  }
```

+ Some statements can be used as top-level definitions:
  - ``typedef`` statements (**6**)
  - variable declarations and initializations

+ Finally, definitions for using qualified constants are allowed, (**2**) e.g.
```
  using std::vector ;
```


==Argument lists, declarations, and function bodies==

- An **argument list** is a comma-separated list of argument declarations.
It is enclosed in parentheses: ``(`` and ``)``. (**1**)

- An argument **declaration** always has a type. This type is optionally
followed by an identifier or an identifier and an initialization,
and optionally preceded by the specifier ``const``.  (**4**)
The following
are examples of argument declarations.
```
  int
  int x
  int x = 5
  const int& x
```
Notice that argument declarations with multiple variables
(``int x, y``) are not included. Exception see below:
A declaration that occurs
as a statement can also have one or more variables.

- A **function body** is either a list of statements enclosed
in curly brackets ``{`` and ``}`` (**1**),
or an empty body consisting
of a semicolon (**6**).  Example:
```
  int foo(double x, int y) ;
```


==Statements==

+ Any **expression** followed by a semicolon ``;`` can be used as a statement. (**1**)

+ Any **declaration** followed by a semicolon ``;`` can be used as a statement. (**2**)
Declarations have the same form as argument declarations in functions,
except that they can have more than one variable.

+ Statements **return**ing an expression (**1**), for example
```
  return i + 9 ;
```

+ **While** loops, with an expression in parentheses followed by a statement. (**3**)  For
example:
```
  while (i < 10) ++i ;
```

+ **Do-while** loops, with an expression in parentheses after the loop body. (**6**)  For
example:
```
  do ++i ; while (i < 10) ;
```

+ **For** loops, with a declaration and two expressions in parentheses followed
by a statement. (**6**)  For example:
```
  for (int i = 0 ; i != 10 ; ++i) k = k + i ;
```
We do not require that any of the fields in parentheses may be empty.

+ **Conditionals**: ``if`` with an expression in parentheses followed by
a statement and optionally by ``else`` and a statement. (**3**)  Examples:
```
  if (x > 0) return x ;

  if (x > 0) return x ; else return y ;
```

+ **Blocks**: any list of statement (including empty list) between
curly brackets. (**3**)  For instance,
```
  {
    int i = 2 ;
    {
    }
    i++ ;
  }
```

+ **Type definitions**: a type and a name for it. (**3**)  Example:
```
  typedef vector<string> Text ;
```


Note: semicolons are not used after curly brackets, but they are
obligatory in all statements and definitions not ending with curly
brackets.

==Expressions==

%**(Associativities differ slightly from 2014 assignment!)**

The following table gives the expressions,
their precedence levels, and their associativity.
The associativity of operators is given as left, right, or none.
For binary operators, in general any of the three associativity is meaningful.
For pre-, post-, and mixfix operators, at most one of
left or right associativity makes sense, and the alternative is non-associative.
As they are bracketed, the argument in an array index and
the arguments in a function call can be expressions of any level.
Otherwise, some subexpressions have to be one precedence level above of
the main expression to implement the required the associativity.

**Note**. The table is not exactly the same as in the C++ standard.


|| level | expression forms                     | assoc   | explanation | test ||
|  16    | literal                              | ---     | atomic expressions |  (**1**)  |
|  16    | ``i``, ``c::i``, ``c::c::i``, ...    | ---     | qualified constants |  (**1**)  |
|  15    | ``e[e]``                             | left    | indexing |  (**3**)  |
|  15    | ``e(e,...,e)``                       | none    | function call |  (**3**)  |
|  14    | ``e.e``, ``e->e``                    | left    | structure projection |  (**3**)  |
|  14    | ``e++``, ``e--``                     | left    | in/decrement |  |
|  13    | ``++e``, ``--e``, ``*e``, ``!e``     | right   | in/decrement, dereference, negation |  (**6**)  |
|  12    | ``e*e``, ``e/e``, ``e%e``            | left    | multiplication, division, remainder |  (**3**)  |
|  11    | ``e+e``, ``e-e``                     | left    | addition, subtraction |  (**3**)  |
|  10    | ``e<<e``, ``e>>e``                   | left    | left and right shift |  (**1**)  |
|   9    | ``e<e``, ``e>e``, ``e>=e``, ``e<=e`` | none    | comparison |  (**6**)  |
|   8    | ``e==e``, ``e!=e``                   | none    | (in)equality |  (**3**)  |
|   4    | ``e&&e``                             | left    | conjunction |  (**6**)  |
|   3    | ``e||e``                             | left    | disjunction |  (**6**)  |
|   2    | ``e=e``, ``e+=e``, ``e-=e``          | right   | assignment |  (**3**)  |
|   2    | ``e ? e : e``                        | right   | conditional |  (**3**)  |
|   1    | ``throw e``                          | right   | exception |  (**4**)  |

Note that increment, decrement, and assignment are //syntactically// permitted
on any expression, not just on variables (and other so-called //l-values//).


==Qualified constants and template instantiations==

**Qualified constants** are constant names separated by ``::`` such as ``std::cout``.
Names can be identifiers (**1**) but also **template instantiations** (**3**), of the form
```
  ident < typelist >
```
where a typelist is a comma-separated list of types. Thus possible
qualified constants include
```
  std::cout
  std::vector<int>::const_iterator
```
One simple way to implement qualified constants is as
nonempty lists separated by ``::``. The elements of the list
are identifiers and template instantiations. Single identifier
expressions come out as a special case of these lists.



==Types==

+ Built-in types: ``int`` (**1**), ``bool``, ``char``, ``double``, ``void``.

+ Qualified constants, including plain identifiers (**1**), e.g. ``string``.

+ Type references. (**4**)
The reference operator ``&`` is a
postfix-operator forming types from types, e.g. ``int &``.


==Literals==

+ Non-negative **Integer** literals, e.g, ``0``, ``00``, ``20``, ``151``. (**1**)
+ Non-negative **Floating point** literals, e.g., ``01.10``, ``3.14``, ``10.0e10``, ``0.00e-00``, ``1.1e-80``. (**3**)
+ Single-quoted **character** literals, e.g. ``'0'``, ``'a'``, ``'"'``, ``'''``. (**6**)
+ Double-quoted **string** literals, e.g. ``"abc"``,
``"This,\n is \"insane\"!"``, ``"LaTeX's \"\\newcommand\""``. (**1**)
A string literal may consist of many double-quoted character sequences
which will be concatenated.  The parts can be divided over lines (**3**).  E.g.,
```
  "hello " "my little "
  "world"
```
will be parsed as string literal "hello my little world".


==Identifiers==

An **identifier** is a letter followed by a list of letters, digits,
and underscores.  (**1**)


==Comments==

+ **Preprocessor directive**: anything from token ``#`` to the end of a line or the file.   (**1**)
+ **Line comment**: anything from token ``//`` to the end of a line or the file.  (**1**)
+ **Block comment**: anything between tokens ``/*`` and ``*/``.
Block comments cannot be nested.


=Test programs=

These programs are original code from the web page of the book
//Accelerated C++// (A. Koenig & B. Moo, Addison-Wesley, 2000).

+ [First testsuite/good/1-hello.cc]: Print "Hello, world!".

+ [Second testsuite/good/2-greet.cc]: Ask the user's name and say hello to him/her.

+ [Third testsuite/good/3-med.cc]: Compute the grade of a student.

+ [Fourth testsuite/good/4-grade.cc]: A smarter way to compute the grade.

+ [Fifth testsuite/good/5-palin.cc]: Test if a string is a palindrome.

+ [Sixth testsuite/good/6-grammar.cc]: Random-generate English sentences.


Once again: build the grammar gradually so that you can parse
these files in this order.


=Success criteria=

Your grammar must pass the [test suite testsuite/index.html] and meet the
specification in this document in all respects. The test suite contains the
example programs, as well as a number of programs which your parser must reject.

The maximum number of 10 **shift/reduce conflicts** is permitted.
The minimum of 2 is almost unavoidable (the "dangling ``else``",
and template instantiation vs. less-than operator).
But reduce/reduce conflicts are forbidden.

The solution must be written in an easily readable and maintainable way. In
particular, tailoring it for the programs in the test suite is not maintainable!

= Submission =

Submit your lab using [Fire https://plt-lp2-16.frs.cse.chalmers.se/].
Do not submit your solution before it passes the test suite - it will
be returned automatically.

If you have any problems getting the test program to run,
or if you think that there is an error in the test suite,
contact the teachers of the course via the mailing list.



=Appendix: C++ features=

Assuming you know some C but not C++, here is a summary of the extra features
of C++ involved in this lab.

Qualified names: ``s::n``, where ``s`` is a name space or a class.

``using`` directives: license to use an unqualified name from a name space.

IO streams: ``cout`` for output, ``cin`` for input. Output is
produced by the left shift operator, input is read by the right shift.
Example from [the second program testsuite/good/2-greet.cc]:
```
  // read the name
  std::string name;     // define `name'
  std::cin >> name;     // read into `name'

  // write a greeting
  std::cout << "Hello, " << name  << "!" << std::endl;
```

Templates, e.g. generic types: ``vector<int>`` is a vector of integers.

Arguments passed by reference (``&``),
with the possibility of forbidding modification (``const``), e.g.
(from [the sixth program testsuite/good/6-grammar.cc])
```
  gen_aux(const Grammar& g, const string& word, vector<string>& ret)
```
