=Description=

The aim of the course is to give understanding of how programming
languages are designed, documented, and implemented. The course covers
the basic techniques and tools needed to write interpreters, and
gives a summary introduction to compilation as well.  Those who have
passed the course should be able to
+ define the lexical structure of programming languages by using
  regular expressions, explain the functioning of finite automata,
  and implement lexical analysers by using standard tools;
+ define the syntax of programming languages by using context-free
  grammars, explain the principles of LL and LR parsing, and implement
  parsers by using standard tools;
+ define and implement abstract syntax;
+ master the technique of syntax-directed translation and its
  efficient implementation in their chosen programming language;
+ formulate typing rules and implement type checkers;
+ formulate operational semantic rules and implement interpreters;
+ write simple code generators;
+ be familiar with the basic implementation issues of both
  imperative and functional languages;
+ design and implement special-purpose programming languages.
+ master the principles of polymorphic type checking by unification
+ implement an interpreter for a functional language

assistants.


The fastest way to get an answer is to mail the course's
Google group
http://groups.google.com/group/plt-2015-lp3.
**Please provide your full name and date of birth when requesting membership!**
Otherwise your request will be bounced back or ignored.

=Google Group=

If you have any general questions regarding the course, the labs or the exercises,
please ask them in our
Google group
http://groups.google.com/group/plt-2015-lp3.
This will reach all teachers and fellow students.
If you are not yet member of the group, you have to
- get a google account (if you don't have it yet)
- go to http://groups.google.com/group/plt-2015-lp3.
- request an invitation to the plt-2015-lp3 group.


**You will have to give your real name and your person number (or date of birth) when you register,**
**otherwise your membership is not approved.**
This is necessary to identify you as a participant of the course.


=Laboration times and supervision=

Times:
- Tuesday 15-17 (no class on 3 February) (Inari, Daniel) , in ED3507.
- Thursday 15-17 (no class on 19 February) (Daniel, Mauricio), in ED2480.
- Friday 13-15 (no class on 20 February) (Inari, Mauricio), in ED3507.


The lab rooms and supervision
are available from Tuesday 20 January till 10 March.

**Attendance in these classes is optional**.
Normally, each student should attend **at most one** supervised laboration time each week.
Since attendance is not compulsory, there may be room for more
times. But, if there is lack of room, those who attend their first
supervision of the week have priority to get a place and supervisor help.


=Laborations=

There will be four laborations, written individually or in
pairs.
- deadline 2/2:  [parser laborations/lab1/lab1.html]
- deadline 16/2: [type checker and interpreter laborations/lab2/lab2.html]  (tentative!)
- deadline 25/2: [code generator laborations/lab3/lab3.html]                  (tentative!)
- deadline 10/3: [functional language interpreter laborations/lab4/lab4.html]  (tentative!)


Reporting is done via
[Fire http://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/plt/].
Before reporting, you must run your program through a test suite,
such as the one for [lab 1 laborations/lab1/testscript/].

**Final deadline is Saturday 14 March** for all returned and corrected labs.
No labs will be graded after this deadline.

We guarantee two gradings per lab: one for the version submitted before the
ordinary deadline for that lab, the other for a resubmission before
the final deadline. If your first submission is after the lab
deadline, only one grading is guaranteed.


=Literature=

The main book will be one that developed from earlier editions of this course:

- Ranta:
//Implementing Programming Languages. An Introductions to Compilers and Interpreters//,
College Publications,
London,
2012.
Web page (with extra material and links to selling sites):
http://www.digitalgrammars.com/ipl-book/


If you are really interested in the topic, for instance, if you want
to continue with the [Compiler Construction http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/TDA282/] 
course, you should also consider //the Dragon book//,

- Aho, Lam, Sethi & Ullman:
//Compilers Principles, Techniques & Tools//
**Second edition**,
Pearson/Addison Wesley
2007.


Both books are available
at web bookshops. The main book will also be sold at Cremona.


=Exam=

Written exam, usual grading scales.

Date: 20 March

Time: 2:00 afternoon

Place: M (Hörsalsvägen 5)

The exam has the same structure as these [old exams exams/].

Further, here are some 
[exercises http://www.digitalgrammars.com/ipl-book/course-exercises/exx.html]
and [solutions http://www.digitalgrammars.com/ipl-book/course-exercises/sol.html]
to prepare for the exam.
